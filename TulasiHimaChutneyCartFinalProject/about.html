          <div class="panel">
            <p>Chutney is a condiment or sauce that originates from the Indian subcontinent, known for its vibrant flavors and versatility. It is typically made by combining various ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, vinegar, sugar, and sometimes chili peppers. The mixture is then cooked down to a thick, chunky consistency or blended into a smooth paste.</p>

          <button class="accordion">What is a masala?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Masala is a term commonly used in South Asian cuisine to refer to a blend of spices, herbs, and other seasonings that are combined to create a flavorful mixture.

          <button class="accordion">What is a tadka?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Tadka, also known as tempering or seasoning, is a cooking technique commonly used in Indian cuisine to enhance the flavor and aroma of a dish. It involves adding a mixture of spices, herbs, and sometimes other ingredients to hot oil or ghee (clarified butter) and quickly frying them. This process allows the flavors and aromas of the spices to be released and infused into the oil, which is then poured over or added to the dish, elevating its taste and adding a final touch of depth.</p>
